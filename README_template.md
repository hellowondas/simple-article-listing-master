## Create your own `README.md`

To use the Readme template, follow these steps:

1. Open the `README-template.md` file in your text editor.
2. Replace the placeholder content with your own project information.
3. Customize the sections and headings to fit your project's needs.
4. Add a detailed description of your project, including its purpose and features.
5. Reflect on your learning experience and any challenges you encountered during development.
6. Delete the original `README.md` file.
7. Rename the `README-template.md` file to `README.md`.
8. Save the changes and commit the updated `README.md` file to your repository.

By following these instructions, you can create a customized `README.md` file that effectively communicates your project to others.

## Sharing your solution

3.  Write a blog post about your experience building the project. Documenting your workflow, technical choices, and explaining your code is an excellent way to reinforce your learning. Popular platforms for writing include [dev.to](https://dev.to/), [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/), and [CodeNewbie](https://community.codenewbie.org/).
